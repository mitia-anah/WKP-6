# Explanation about my WKP-6 project

## 1. structure of the project:
	In this project, the first thing that I did was creating the html, then I linked it with the script.js file. To make sure that I only have a few elements inside of it, for instance, there I created the checkbox type, `div` element to hold the future list which will create on the javascript file and `button` element.
		
## 2. Area of work would I improve?
	If only I had more time, I would still worked on the fourth tip of the project, which is about `filtering the spicy and vegetarian food`.

## 3. New things that I learn while working on this project:
	At first, I was a bit struggling to get the list of five meals unless I use button to click to show the lists, but later I knew that we can call the function so that we can get rid of the button.

## 4. The most challenging part for me?
	I spent lots of time to solve the filtering list to see only the vegetarian meals, or only the spicy ones but I could not solved it yet. I mean, it is hard for me to get the checkbox works. 

## 5. Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?
I would like if we can go back to reexplain the way how we could solve this: "Filter the list to see only the vegetarian meals, or only the spicy ones"".

## 6. Any comments? (edited)
